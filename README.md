# nhlstats - nhl shot probability statistics

Import works as follows:
- Fetch data from nhl open api (all individual play info, player info, team info, game info, etc...)
- Clean data and build models on the data
- Transform data and use models to create new metrics
- Push to RDS hosted Postgres db

More info/details will be posted soon with documentation!
